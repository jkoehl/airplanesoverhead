Person: 
- I have an iOS app called AirplanesOverhead that you helped create for me. It looks up the current aircraft flying overhead using the FlightAware API and then announces information about each aircraft. I would like some help in making changes. Here is the current source code for the iOS app. It uses SwiftUI and this is the ContentView.swift file. import SwiftUI

    let actual_on: String?
    let origin: Airport?
    let destination: Airport?

ChatGPT: 
- Sure, I can help you make changes to your iOS app called AirplanesOverhead. Please let me know what changes you would like to make.

Person: 
- Is there a way I can have it load my API key from a configuration file or info.plist value so it isn't hard coded?

ChatGPT: 
- Yes, you can store your API key in a configuration file or info.plist value, and then load it in your app. Here's an example of how you can modify your code to load the API key from an info.plist value:
1. In your Xcode project, open the info.plist file. 
2. Add a new key called `FlightAwareAPIKey` and set its value to your API key. 
3. Modify the `fetchAircraftData` function to load the API key from the info.plist value like this:

```swift

func fetchAircraftData(location: CLLocation, radius: Double, completion: @escaping ([Flight]) -> Void) {
    let baseURL = "https://aeroapi.flightaware.com/aeroapi/flights/search"
    let lat = location.coordinate.latitude
    let lon = location.coordinate.longitude
    let query = "-latlong \"\(lat - radius) \(lon - radius) \(lat + radius) \(lon + radius)\""

    let parameters: [String: Any] = [
        "query": query
    ]

    // Load the API key from the info.plist value.
    guard let apiKey = Bundle.main.infoDictionary?["FlightAwareAPIKey"] as? String else {
        print("FlightAware API key not found.")
        return
    }

    let headers: HTTPHeaders = [
        "x-apikey": apiKey
    ]

    AF.request(baseURL, method: .get, parameters: parameters, headers: headers).responseDecodable(of: FlightResponse.self) { response in
        switch response.result {
        case .success(let flightResponse):
            DispatchQueue.main.async {
                completion(flightResponse.flights)
            }
        case .failure(let error):
            print("Error fetching aircraft data:", error)
        }
    }
}
```



With this change, the API key is loaded from the info.plist value and used in the request headers. This way, you can avoid hardcoding the API key in your source code.

Person: 
- How do I add this property value to the info.plist in the Xcode UI?

ChatGPT: 
- Sure, here's how you can add a property to the info.plist file in Xcode:
1. Open your Xcode project and select your project in the Project navigator on the left side of the window.
2. Select the target you want to modify.
3. Click on the "Info" tab at the top of the window.
4. Click on the "+" button at the bottom of the "Custom iOS Target Properties" section.
5. In the "Key" column, type "FlightAwareAPIKey".
6. In the "Value" column, type your API key.

Alternatively, you can also directly edit the info.plist file by right-clicking on the file in the Project navigator, selecting "Open As", and then choosing "Source Code". Then you can add the following XML code to the file, replacing `your_api_key_here` with your actual API key:

```xml

<key>FlightAwareAPIKey</key>
<string>your_api_key_here</string>
```



Make sure to save the changes to the file after you have made them.

Person: 
- We should probably move that code up so that we only lookup the API key at the start of the app.

ChatGPT: 
- That's a good idea! You can modify your code to load the API key at the start of the app and store it in a property, so that you can use it later whenever you need to make a request to the FlightAware API. Here's an example of how you can do that: 
1. Add a new property to your `ContentView` struct to store the API key:

```swift

struct ContentView: View {
    // ...
    private let flightAwareAPIKey: String

    init() {
        // Load the API key from the info.plist value at initialization time.
        guard let apiKey = Bundle.main.infoDictionary?["FlightAwareAPIKey"] as? String else {
            fatalError("FlightAware API key not found.")
        }
        self.flightAwareAPIKey = apiKey

        let manufacturersLookup = Self.loadManufacturersLookup(from: "manufacturers")
        let lookup = Self.loadAircraftTypeLookup(from: "aircraft-types", usingManufacturers: manufacturersLookup)
        _aircraftTypeLookup = State(initialValue: lookup)
    }
    // ...
}
```

 
1. Modify the `fetchAircraftData` function to use the `flightAwareAPIKey` property:

```swift

func fetchAircraftData(location: CLLocation, radius: Double, completion: @escaping ([Flight]) -> Void) {
    let baseURL = "https://aeroapi.flightaware.com/aeroapi/flights/search"
    let lat = location.coordinate.latitude
    let lon = location.coordinate.longitude
    let query = "-latlong \"\(lat - radius) \(lon - radius) \(lat + radius) \(lon + radius)\""

    let parameters: [String: Any] = [
        "query": query
    ]

    let headers: HTTPHeaders = [
        "x-apikey": flightAwareAPIKey
    ]

    AF.request(baseURL, method: .get, parameters: parameters, headers: headers).responseDecodable(of: FlightResponse.self) { response in
        switch response.result {
        case .success(let flightResponse):
            DispatchQueue.main.async {
                completion(flightResponse.flights)
            }
        case .failure(let error):
            print("Error fetching aircraft data:", error)
        }
    }
}
```



With these changes, the API key is loaded at initialization time and stored in the `flightAwareAPIKey` property. This way, you can avoid looking up the API key every time you make a request to the FlightAware API.

Person: 
- Can you add the ability for it to describe the aircraft's origin and destination information?

ChatGPT: 
- Yes, we can modify the code to display the aircraft's origin and destination information. Here's an example of how you can modify the code: 
1. Add new properties to your `Flight` struct to store the origin and destination airport information:

```swift

struct Flight: Codable, Identifiable {
    let id: UUID = UUID()
    let ident: String?
    let fa_flight_id: String?
    let actual_off: String?
    let actual_on: String?
    let origin: Airport?
    let destination: Airport?
    let last_position: Position?
    let aircraft_type: String?

    struct Airport: Codable {
        let code: String?
        let code_icao: String?
        let code_iata: String?
        let code_lid: String?
        let timezone: String?
        let name: String?
        let city: String?
        let airport_info_url: String?
    }

    struct Position: Codable {
        let fa_flight_id: String?
        let altitude: Int?
        let altitude_change: String?
        let groundspeed: Int?
        let heading: Int?
        let latitude: Double?
        let longitude: Double?
        let timestamp: String?
        let update_type: String?
    }

    var originDescription: String {
        guard let originAirport = origin else {
            return "Unknown origin"
        }
        return "From \(originAirport.name ?? "") (\(originAirport.code_icao ?? ""))"
    }

    var destinationDescription: String {
        guard let destinationAirport = destination else {
            return "Unknown destination"
        }
        return "To \(destinationAirport.name ?? "") (\(destinationAirport.code_icao ?? ""))"
    }
}
```

 
1. Modify the `List` view to display the origin and destination information:

```swift

List(aircraftData) { flight in
    if let aircraftType = aircraftTypeLookup[flight.aircraft_type ?? ""] {
        VStack(alignment: .leading) {
            Text("\(aircraftType)")
            Text("\(flight.originDescription)")
            Text("\(flight.destinationDescription)")
        }
    } else {
        Text("Unknown aircraft")
    }
}
```



With these changes, the origin and destination information is displayed for each aircraft in the list. Note that we added two new computed properties to the `Flight` struct, `originDescription` and `destinationDescription`, to generate the description strings for the origin and destination airports.

Person: 
- Can you also please have it speak that information as well?

ChatGPT: 
- Sure, we can modify the code to have the app speak the origin and destination information along with the aircraft type, altitude, and speed. Here's an example of how you can modify the code: 
1. Modify the `speakAircraftData` function to include the origin and destination information:

```swift

func speakAircraftData() {
    for flight in aircraftData {
        if let aircraftType = aircraftTypeLookup[flight.aircraft_type ?? ""] {
            var speechText = "There is a \(aircraftType) "
            if let altitude = flight.last_position?.altitude {
                speechText += "flying at an altitude of \(altitude) feet "
            }
            if let groundspeed = flight.last_position?.groundspeed {
                speechText += "and a speed of \(groundspeed) knots. "
            }
            speechText += "\(flight.originDescription) \(flight.destinationDescription)"
            speechSynthesizer.speak(AVSpeechUtterance(string: speechText))
        }
    }
}
```



With these changes, the `speakAircraftData` function now includes the origin and destination information along with the aircraft type, altitude, and speed in the speech text.

Note that we added the `originDescription` and `destinationDescription` computed properties to the `Flight` struct in the previous step to generate the origin and destination description strings. We are using those properties here to generate the speech text.

Person: 
- Can you add a drop down option to the View that allows the user to select the search radius with options of 1, 5, and 10 miles and use that value to calculate the search area?

ChatGPT: 
- Yes, we can modify the code to add a dropdown to the View that allows the user to select the search radius. Here's an example of how you can modify the code: 
1. Add a new `searchRadius` property to the `ContentView` struct to store the selected search radius:

```swift

struct ContentView: View {
    // ...
    private let searchRadiusOptions = [1.0, 5.0, 10.0]
    @State private var searchRadius = 1.0
    // ...
}
```



Here, we added a `searchRadius` property that is initialized to `1.0`, and an array of `searchRadiusOptions` that contains the available search radius values. 
1. Add a new `Picker` view to the `VStack` that allows the user to select the search radius:

```swift

VStack {
    Text("Tap to find aircraft flying nearby")
        .padding()
    Picker("Search Radius", selection: $searchRadius) {
        ForEach(searchRadiusOptions, id: \.self) { radius in
            Text("\(Int(radius)) miles")
        }
    }
    .pickerStyle(SegmentedPickerStyle())
    .padding()
    Button(action: {
        if let location = locationManager.location {
            fetchAircraftData(location: location, radius: searchRadius / 69.0) { aircraftData in
                self.aircraftData = aircraftData
                speakAircraftData()
            }
        }
    }) {
        Image(systemName: "airplane")
            .font(.system(size: 72))
    }
    .padding()
    // ...
}
```



Here, we added a new `Picker` view that allows the user to select the search radius from the available options. We are binding the `searchRadius` property to the selected value of the `Picker`. We also modified the `fetchAircraftData` function to calculate the search area using the `searchRadius` value, which is converted from miles to degrees of latitude and longitude using a rough approximation of 69 miles per degree.

With these changes, the app now allows the user to select the search radius, and uses the selected radius to fetch aircraft data and generate speech output.

Person: 
- Let's remove the list contents while we are fetching the aircraft data and display a loading message. If there are no flights found lets display that when it completes.

ChatGPT: 
- Sure, we can modify the code to remove the list contents while fetching aircraft data, and display a loading message. If no flights are found, we can display a message to the user. 
1. Modify the `ContentView` struct to add a `loading` state variable and update the `List` view to show a loading message:

```swift

struct ContentView: View {
    // ...
    @State private var loading = false
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Tap to find aircraft flying nearby")
                .padding()
            Picker("Search Radius", selection: $searchRadius) {
                ForEach(searchRadiusOptions, id: \.self) { radius in
                    Text("\(Int(radius)) miles")
                }
            }
            .pickerStyle(SegmentedPickerStyle())
            .padding()
            Button(action: {
                if let location = locationManager.location {
                    loading = true
                    fetchAircraftData(location: location, radius: searchRadius / 69.0) { aircraftData in
                        self.aircraftData = aircraftData
                        speakAircraftData()
                        loading = false
                    }
                }
            }) {
                Image(systemName: "airplane")
                    .font(.system(size: 72))
            }
            .padding()
            if loading {
                Text("Loading...")
            } else if aircraftData.isEmpty {
                Text("No flights found.")
            } else {
                List(aircraftData) { flight in
                    if let aircraftType = aircraftTypeLookup[flight.aircraft_type ?? ""] {
                        VStack(alignment: .leading) {
                            Text("\(aircraftType)")
                            Text("\(flight.originDescription)")
                            Text("\(flight.destinationDescription)")
                        }
                    } else {
                        Text("Unknown aircraft")
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        .onAppear {
            locationManager.requestWhenInUseAuthorization()
            locationManager.startUpdatingLocation()
        }
    }
    // ...
}
```



With these changes, we added a new `loading` state variable that is set to `true` while fetching aircraft data. We updated the `List` view to show a loading message when `loading` is true, and a message indicating no flights are found when `aircraftData` is empty. 
1. Modify the `fetchAircraftData` function to set `aircraftData` to an empty array when there are no flights found:

```swift

func fetchAircraftData(location: CLLocation, radius: Double, completion: @escaping ([Flight]) -> Void) {
    let baseURL = "https://aeroapi.flightaware.com/aeroapi/flights/search"
    let lat = location.coordinate.latitude
    let lon = location.coordinate.longitude
    let query = "-latlong \"\(lat - radius) \(lon - radius) \(lat + radius) \(lon + radius)\""

    let parameters: [String: Any] = [
        "query": query
    ]

    let headers: HTTPHeaders = [
        "x-apikey": apiKey
    ]

    AF.request(baseURL, method: .get, parameters: parameters, headers: headers).responseDecodable(of: FlightResponse.self) { response in
        switch response.result {
        case .success(let flightResponse):
            DispatchQueue.main.async {
                if flightResponse.flights.isEmpty {
                    self.aircraftData = []
                } else {
                    completion(flightResponse.flights)
                }
            }
        case .failure(let error):
            print("Error fetching aircraft data:", error)
        }
    }
}
```



With these changes, we modified the `fetchAircraftData` function to set `aircraftData` to an empty array when there are no flights found, and to call the `completion` handler only when there are flights

Person: 
- The view still says it is loading if we fetch aircraft and don't find any

ChatGPT: 
- You're right, apologies for the oversight. We can fix that by setting `loading` to `false` in the `case .success` block of the `fetchAircraftData` function, after updating `aircraftData`. Here's the modified code:

```swift

func fetchAircraftData(location: CLLocation, radius: Double, completion: @escaping ([Flight]) -> Void) {
    let baseURL = "https://aeroapi.flightaware.com/aeroapi/flights/search"
    let lat = location.coordinate.latitude
    let lon = location.coordinate.longitude
    let query = "-latlong \"\(lat - radius) \(lon - radius) \(lat + radius) \(lon + radius)\""

    let parameters: [String: Any] = [
        "query": query
    ]

    let headers: HTTPHeaders = [
        "x-apikey": apiKey
    ]

    AF.request(baseURL, method: .get, parameters: parameters, headers: headers).responseDecodable(of: FlightResponse.self) { response in
        switch response.result {
        case .success(let flightResponse):
            DispatchQueue.main.async {
                if flightResponse.flights.isEmpty {
                    self.aircraftData = []
                } else {
                    completion(flightResponse.flights)
                }
                self.loading = false // <-- Add this line
            }
        case .failure(let error):
            print("Error fetching aircraft data:", error)
        }
    }
}
```



With this change, the `loading` state variable is set to `false` in the `case .success` block of the `fetchAircraftData` function, after updating `aircraftData`. This ensures that the loading message is cleared when there are no flights found.

Person: 
- Lets add a button that will stop the speech synthesizer before it is finished speaking

ChatGPT: 
- Sure! We can add a stop button to stop the speech synthesizer. Here's an example of how you can modify the code: 
1. Add a new `stopSpeakingButton` view to the `VStack`:

```swift

VStack {
    Text("Tap to find aircraft flying nearby")
        .padding()
    Picker("Search Radius", selection: $searchRadius) {
        ForEach(searchRadiusOptions, id: \.self) { radius in
            Text("\(Int(radius)) miles")
        }
    }
    .pickerStyle(SegmentedPickerStyle())
    .padding()
    Button(action: {
        if let location = locationManager.location {
            loading = true
            fetchAircraftData(location: location, radius: searchRadius / 69.0) { aircraftData in
                self.aircraftData = aircraftData
                speakAircraftData()
                loading = false
            }
        }
    }) {
        Image(systemName: "airplane")
            .font(.system(size: 72))
    }
    .padding()
    if loading {
        Text("Loading...")
    } else if aircraftData.isEmpty {
        Text("No flights found.")
    } else {
        List(aircraftData) { flight in
            if let aircraftType = aircraftTypeLookup[flight.aircraft_type ?? ""] {
                VStack(alignment: .leading) {
                    Text("\(aircraftType)")
                    Text("\(flight.originDescription)")
                    Text("\(flight.destinationDescription)")
                }
            } else {
                Text("Unknown aircraft")
            }
        }
    }
    Button(action: {
        speechSynthesizer.stopSpeaking(at: .immediate)
    }) {
        Text("Stop Speaking")
    }
}
```



Here, we added a new `Button` view that calls `speechSynthesizer.stopSpeaking` when tapped. 
1. Modify the `speakAircraftData` function to set the `stopSpeakingButton` state variable to `true` when the speech synthesizer is speaking:

```swift

func speakAircraftData() {
    stopSpeakingButton = true // <-- Add this line
    for flight in aircraftData {
        if let aircraftType = aircraftTypeLookup[flight.aircraft_type ?? ""] {
            let speechText = "There is a \(aircraftType) flying at an altitude of \(flight.last_position?.altitude ?? 0) feet and a speed of \(flight.last_position?.groundspeed ?? 0) knots. Originating from \(flight.originDescription) and flying to \(flight.destinationDescription)."
            let utterance = AVSpeechUtterance(string: speechText)
            utterance.voice = AVSpeechSynthesisVoice(language: "en-US")
            speechSynthesizer.speak(utterance)
            while speechSynthesizer.isSpeaking {
                RunLoop.current.run(mode: .default, before: Date(timeIntervalSinceNow: 0.1))
            }
        }
    }
    stopSpeakingButton = false // <-- Add this line
}
```



Here, we added two lines of code to set the `stopSpeakingButton` state variable to `true` before the speech synthesizer begins speaking, and to set it back to `false` when it finishes speaking.

With these changes, the app now includes a stop button that stops the speech synthesizer when tapped.

Person: 
- Cannot find 'stopSpeakingButton' in scope

ChatGPT: 
- I apologize for that mistake. It seems that `stopSpeakingButton` was not declared as a state variable in the original code. To fix this, you can add the following line inside the `ContentView` struct, right after the declaration of `speechSynthesizer`:

```swift

@State private var stopSpeakingButton = false
```



This creates a new state variable called `stopSpeakingButton` and sets its initial value to `false`.

After adding this line, you should be able to use `stopSpeakingButton` as a state variable in the `ContentView` struct.

Here is the modified code with the addition of `stopSpeakingButton`:

```swift

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var locationManager = CLLocationManager()
    @State private var aircraftData: [Flight] = []
    @State private var aircraftTypeLookup: [String: String]
    @State private var speechSynthesizer = AVSpeechSynthesizer()
    @State private var stopSpeakingButton = false
    
    // ...
    
    func speakAircraftData() {
        stopSpeakingButton = true
        for flight in aircraftData {
            if let aircraftType = aircraftTypeLookup[flight.aircraft_type ?? ""] {
                let speechText = "There is a \(aircraftType) flying at an altitude of \(flight.last_position?.altitude ?? 0) feet and a speed of \(flight.last_position?.groundspeed ?? 0) knots. Originating from \(flight.originDescription) and flying to \(flight.destinationDescription)."
                let utterance = AVSpeechUtterance(string: speechText)
                utterance.voice = AVSpeechSynthesisVoice(language: "en-US")
                speechSynthesizer.speak(utterance)
                while speechSynthesizer.isSpeaking {
                    if stopSpeakingButton { // Check if stop button was tapped
                        speechSynthesizer.stopSpeaking(at: .immediate)
                        break
                    }
                    RunLoop.current.run(mode: .default, before: Date(timeIntervalSinceNow: 0.1))
                }
            }
        }
        stopSpeakingButton = false
    }
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            // ...
            
            Button(action: {
                if let location = locationManager.location {
                    loading = true
                    fetchAircraftData(location: location, radius: searchRadius / 69.0) { aircraftData in
                        self.aircraftData = aircraftData
                        speakAircraftData()
                        loading = false
                    }
                }
            }) {
                Image(systemName: "airplane")
                    .font(.system(size: 72))
            }
            .padding()
            if loading {
                Text("Loading...")
            } else if aircraftData.isEmpty {
                Text("No flights found.")
            } else {
                List(aircraftData) { flight in
                    if let aircraftType = aircraftTypeLookup[flight.aircraft_type ?? ""] {
                        VStack(alignment: .leading) {
                            Text("\(aircraftType)")
                            Text("\(flight.originDescription)")
                            Text("\(flight.destinationDescription)")
                        }
                    } else {
                        Text("Unknown aircraft")
                    }
                }
            }
            Button(action: {
                stopSpeakingButton = true // Set stopSpeakingButton to true when button is tapped
            }) {
                Text("Stop Speaking")
            }
        }
        .onAppear {
            locationManager.requestWhenInUseAuthorization()
            locationManager.startUpdatingLocation()
        }
    }
}
```



I hope this helps!

    func fetchAircraftData(location: CLLocation, radius: Double
```

Person: 
- Can you generate. speakAircraftData again it seems that it no longer speaks

ChatGPT: 
- You're right, I apologize for that. Here's the modified `speakAircraftData` function that should work correctly:

```swift

func speakAircraftData() {
    stopSpeakingButton = true
    for flight in aircraftData {
        if let aircraftType = aircraftTypeLookup[flight.aircraft_type ?? ""] {
            let originDescription = flight.originDescription
            let destinationDescription = flight.destinationDescription
            let altitude = flight.last_position?.altitude ?? 0
            let groundspeed = flight.last_position?.groundspeed ?? 0
            
            let speechText = "There is a \(aircraftType) flying at an altitude of \(altitude) feet and a speed of \(groundspeed) knots. Originating from \(originDescription) and flying to \(destinationDescription)."
            let utterance = AVSpeechUtterance(string: speechText)
            utterance.voice = AVSpeechSynthesisVoice(language: "en-US")
            speechSynthesizer.speak(utterance)
            while speechSynthesizer.isSpeaking {
                if stopSpeakingButton { // Check if stop button was tapped
                    speechSynthesizer.stopSpeaking(at: .immediate)
                    break
                }
                RunLoop.current.run(mode: .default, before: Date(timeIntervalSinceNow: 0.1))
            }
        }
    }
    stopSpeakingButton = false
}
```



I hope this works better for you!

Person: 
- I think speakAircraftData has a bug where it starts with stopSpeakingButton being true so it won't ever start

ChatGPT: 
- You are correct, my apologies for that mistake. The `stopSpeakingButton` should be initialized to `false` instead of `true`. Here's the corrected version:

```swift

func speakAircraftData() {
    stopSpeakingButton = false // Initialize stopSpeakingButton to false
    for flight in aircraftData {
        if let aircraftType = aircraftTypeLookup[flight.aircraft_type ?? ""] {
            let originDescription = flight.originDescription
            let destinationDescription = flight.destinationDescription
            let altitude = flight.last_position?.altitude ?? 0
            let groundspeed = flight.last_position?.groundspeed ?? 0
            
            let speechText = "There is a \(aircraftType) flying at an altitude of \(altitude) feet and a speed of \(groundspeed) knots. Originating from \(originDescription) and flying to \(destinationDescription)."
            let utterance = AVSpeechUtterance(string: speechText)
            utterance.voice = AVSpeechSynthesisVoice(language: "en-US")
            speechSynthesizer.speak(utterance)
            while speechSynthesizer.isSpeaking {
                if stopSpeakingButton { // Check if stop button was tapped
                    speechSynthesizer.stopSpeaking(at: .immediate)
                    break
                }
                RunLoop.current.run(mode: .default, before: Date(timeIntervalSinceNow: 0.1))
            }
        }
    }
    stopSpeakingButton = false // Reset stopSpeakingButton to false after speaking finishes
}
```



Thank you for bringing this to my attention.

Person: 
- When it starts to speak it doesn't allow the list of aircraft to render until it is complete

ChatGPT: 
- That's because the `while` loop inside the `speakAircraftData` function blocks the main thread, preventing the UI from updating until the speech finishes. To fix this, we can move the speech synthesis to a background thread so that it does not block the main thread. Here's an updated version of the `speakAircraftData` function that should work better:

```swift

func speakAircraftData() {
    stopSpeakingButton = false
    DispatchQueue.global(qos: .userInitiated).async {
        for flight in aircraftData {
            if let aircraftType = aircraftTypeLookup[flight.aircraft_type ?? ""] {
                let originDescription = flight.originDescription
                let destinationDescription = flight.destinationDescription
                let altitude = flight.last_position?.altitude ?? 0
                let groundspeed = flight.last_position?.groundspeed ?? 0
                
                let speechText = "There is a \(aircraftType) flying at an altitude of \(altitude) feet and a speed of \(groundspeed) knots. Originating from \(originDescription) and flying to \(destinationDescription)."
                let utterance = AVSpeechUtterance(string: speechText)
                utterance.voice = AVSpeechSynthesisVoice(language: "en-US")
                speechSynthesizer.speak(utterance)
                while speechSynthesizer.isSpeaking {
                    if stopSpeakingButton {
                        speechSynthesizer.stopSpeaking(at: .immediate)
                        break
                    }
                    RunLoop.current.run(mode: .default, before: Date(timeIntervalSinceNow: 0.1))
                }
            }
        }
        stopSpeakingButton = false
    }
}
```



This version moves the `for` loop that speaks each flight to a background thread using `DispatchQueue.global(qos: .userInitiated).async`, which allows the UI to update while the speech is in progress. Let me know if this resolves the issue!

Person: 
- For the origin and destination descriptions let's just name the airport and not the identifier

ChatGPT: 
- Sure, we can modify the `originDescription` and `destinationDescription` properties to return just the airport name instead of the identifier. Here's the updated code:

```swift

extension Flight {
    var originDescription: String {
        if let origin = self.origin {
            return origin.name ?? "Unknown airport"
        } else {
            return "Unknown origin"
        }
    }
    
    var destinationDescription: String {
        if let destination = self.destination {
            return destination.name ?? "Unknown airport"
        } else {
            return "Unknown destination"
        }
    }
}
```



This version returns the `name` property of the `Airport` struct instead of the `code_iata` property. Let me know if this works for you!

Person: 
- When describing the altitude of the aircraft the value from FlightAware is called a flight level and we should say something like "flight level three four zero" instead of "340 feet".

ChatGPT: 
- You're right, thank you for bringing this to my attention. The altitude reported by FlightAware is indeed in flight level, which is a measure of altitude used in aviation. Here's the updated code for the `speakAircraftData` function to speak the flight level:

```swift

func speakAircraftData() {
    stopSpeakingButton = false
    DispatchQueue.global(qos: .userInitiated).async {
        for flight in aircraftData {
            if let aircraftType = aircraftTypeLookup[flight.aircraft_type ?? ""] {
                let originDescription = flight.originDescription
                let destinationDescription = flight.destinationDescription
                let flightLevel = flight.last_position?.altitude ?? 0
                let groundspeed = flight.last_position?.groundspeed ?? 0
                
                let speechText = "There is a \(aircraftType) flying at flight level \(flightLevel / 100) and a speed of \(groundspeed) knots. Originating from \(originDescription) and flying to \(destinationDescription)."
                let utterance = AVSpeechUtterance(string: speechText)
                utterance.voice = AVSpeechSynthesisVoice(language: "en-US")
                speechSynthesizer.speak(utterance)
                while speechSynthesizer.isSpeaking {
                    if stopSpeakingButton {
                        speechSynthesizer.stopSpeaking(at: .immediate)
                        break
                    }
                    RunLoop.current.run(mode: .default, before: Date(timeIntervalSinceNow: 0.1))
                }
            }
        }
        stopSpeakingButton = false
    }
}
```



This version divides the flight level by 100 to convert it to hundreds of feet, and uses the phrase "flight level" when speaking the altitude. Let me know if this works for you!

Person: 
- In the list view let's include the aircraft speed and flight level after the aircraft type

ChatGPT: 
- Sure, we can modify the `List` in the `ContentView` to display the aircraft speed and flight level for each flight in addition to the aircraft type. Here's the updated code:

```swift

List(aircraftData) { flight in
    if let aircraftType = aircraftTypeLookup[flight.aircraft_type ?? ""] {
        let flightLevel = flight.last_position?.altitude ?? 0
        let groundspeed = flight.last_position?.groundspeed ?? 0
        Text("\(aircraftType) - Flight level \(flightLevel / 100), Speed \(groundspeed) knots")
    } else {
        Text("Unknown aircraft")
    }
}
```



This version includes a `Text` view for each flight that displays the aircraft type, flight level in hundreds of feet, and groundspeed in knots. Let me know if this works for you!

Person: 
- In the list view let's include the aircraft speed and flight level after the aircraft type as well as the name of the origin and destination airport

ChatGPT: 
- Sure, we can modify the `List` in the `ContentView` to display the aircraft speed, flight level, origin airport, and destination airport for each flight in addition to the aircraft type. Here's the updated code:

```swift

List(aircraftData) { flight in

        let flightLevel = flight.last_position?.altitude ?? 0
        let groundspeed = flight.last_position?.groundspeed ?? 0
        let origin = flight.origin?.name ?? "Unknown origin"
        let destination = flight.destination?.name ?? "Unknown destination"
        Text("\(aircraftType) - Flight level \(flightLevel / 100), Speed \(groundspeed) knots, Origin \(origin), Destination \(destination)")
    } else {
        Text("Unknown aircraft")
    }
}
